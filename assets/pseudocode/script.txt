Project Overview: assists the user in choosing dinner recipes based on their appetite/hunger-level and the availability of ingredients in their fridge.

1. When user open the App:
   - Display the homepage with dinner selection options.

2. User selects dinner based on appetite and hunger level (OPTIONAL): 
   - Present options for meat-centric dinner, vegetarian lighter dinner.
   - User make a selection.
   - safe selection to localStorage.
   - Problem with section; initially I thought to define any recipes that include meat as a "big or substantial dinner" and we could filter from APIs by including meat in it. However I was looking at the recipes and I found the following problems.
      - how we define or differentiate orthe "substantial dinner" from "light Dinner" in dynamic way?
      - how filter from the APIs. for example a meat pi 
      - if we dont find a solution to this. we can delete this section the projects.
      
3. Depending on what user has selected prevously:
   - Present a list of Papular ingredient to user as checkboxes:
   - ask the users to check the checkboxes if they want include that in recipes;
   -save the check boxes to  selected-variable or localStorage.
  

4. after the checkboxes are saved:
   - Display a message to user if they want to add more ingredient.
   - provide an input-text and an add button.
   - convert to lowerCase if uppCase is used.
   - values are added to Selected-variable or localStorage by click add or pressing Enter key.

5. retrieve recipes componends from a free recipes server-side APIs by using ajax or Fetch:
   - filter recipes by main ingredients using the user preferences input.
   - retrieve recipes inluding the relevent component and IMG URLs after matched.
   -provid recipes options to the users based on simillarity found.

6. If no recipes matched to the user preference:
   - Prompt the user with a modal message indicating that additional ingredients are required.
   - Provide suggestions for additional ingredients to complete the recipes.

7.append the result to the HTML using the DOM.

8. Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript,localStorage, jquery and server-side APIs to implement the app:

9. List of Possible 3rd pary APIs that could be used;
   - TheMealDB;
      - Free Version: allow only one single ingredient to be filter by main ingredients.
      - filter by multi-ingredient is only available to Paypal supporters.
   

Note: I was assigned to do this pseudocode today at the Zoom meeting.
I believe this is the bare minimum to have a dynamic app. Since this assignment is a major assignment with 20% of the overall mark, it looks much harder compared to the previous one I was looking at. However, I still believe it is doable with good teamwork and some help.
